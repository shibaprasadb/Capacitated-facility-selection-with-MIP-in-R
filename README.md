# Capacitated-facility-selection-with-MIP-in-R
Using the MIPModel from the ompr package in R, a capacitated facility selection problem has been solved here.

Capacitated Facility Location Problem is a special type of Facility Location Problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facility_location_problem) where each facility has a given capacity that it can't exceed. Here in this model, we have taken 500 points for Customers and 20 points as the centers for facilities to be built to demonstrate the model.
