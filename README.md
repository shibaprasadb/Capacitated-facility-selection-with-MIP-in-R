# Capacitated-facility-selection-with-MIP-in-R
Using the MIPModel from the ompr package in R, a capacitated facility selection problem has been solved here.

Capacitated Facility Location Problem is a special type of Facility Location Problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facility_location_problem) where each facility has a given capacity that it can't exceed. To demonstrate how it can be solved here I have taken:

500 points for Customer Locations

20 points for all the potential Facility Locations
