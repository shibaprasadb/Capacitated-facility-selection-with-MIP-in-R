# Capacitated-facility-selection-with-MIP-in-R
Using the MIPModel from the ompr package in R, a capacitated facility selection problem has been solved here.

Capacitated Facility Location Problem is a special type of Facility Location Problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facility_location_problem) where each of the facilities have a prescribed capacities which they can't exceed. Here in this model, we have taken 500 points for Customers and 20 points as the centers for facilities to be built.
